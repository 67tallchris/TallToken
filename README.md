# TallToke

Mostly following this tutorial to make an ERC20 token on the ropsten ethereum testnet:
http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/robust-smart-contracts-with-openzeppelin

Current use case: As Paul and Chris speak about crypto at local events, they will use this token to distribute to participants that want to learn by doing how to setup a wallet, and transfer funds. It is a use case to show how ubiquitous tokens may become in the future, and demonstrate a true utility token (proof of attendance and meeting us).
